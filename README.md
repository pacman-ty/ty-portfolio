# Talha Yildirims Portfolio Website
\:\)

## Using my website as a template for your own 

First create an empty repo for your own portfolio on github.

In your desired directory clone my repo:
`git clone git@github.com:pacman-ty/ty-portfolio.git`

Navigate into the cloned repository:
`cd ty-portfolio`

Remove the original remote: 
`git remote remove origin`

Add your own repository as the new remote:
`git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git`

Push the code to your remote repository:
`git push -u origin main`

Now start changes things up and make it your own
